                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been 
                the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley 
                of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
                but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
                popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of 
                Lorem Ipsum.

                CMake is a great tool for generating a Makefile or any kind of solution file. This post is me going
                over the basics in my little C++ project.
